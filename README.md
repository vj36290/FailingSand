# Failing Sand

## What is it?

A very basic framework for a "falling sand" toy program.

Inspired by programs such as [Burning Sand](http://siebn.de/games/bs) and [Powder Game](https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/).

There's no text rendering yet because rendering text in OpenGL makes me want to commit copyright infringement.

I'll probably add to this readme later, because I don't feel like writing one right now.
